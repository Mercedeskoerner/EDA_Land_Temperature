# EDA_Land_Temperature
## Exploratory Data Analysis to understand climate change over the world
# 
### This data set was extracted from Kaggel. Data is available from 1850 to 2015. 
# It shows how the land and ocean temperature change over the years. We can see a deep analysis to understand tendency and found the exactly period of year where the temperature started to growth. 
# 
### We can see this data: 
### -Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures 
### -LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius 
### -LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average 
###-LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius 
### -LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature 
###-LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius 
###-LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature 
###-LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius 
###-LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature
